# ATEKST Parser

The goal of this python script is to take a clean text export file from Atekst Retriever and convert it into a database friendly format (.csv) for research purposes (qualitative and quantitative coding and analysis).

This is my first real project in python, so forgive my n00bness. Comments, pull request and issues filing is of course appreciated.
